[200~I went my own way and I made it
I'm your favorite reference, baby
Call me Gabbriette, you're so inspired
Ah, ah
I'm tectonic, moves, I make 'em
Shock you like defibrillators
No style? I can't relate
I'll always be the one, ah

[Pre-Chorus]
Drop down, yeah
Put the camera flash on
So stylish
Baby tee is all gone
Drop down, yeah
Lookin' like an icon
Work angles, yeah~
Yeah, 360
When you're in the mirror, do you like what you see?
When you're in the mirror, you're just looking at me
I'm everywhere, I'm so Julia
Ah-ah, ah
When you're in the party b-b-bumpin' that beat
666 with a princess streak
I'm everywhere, I'm so Julia
Ah-ah, ah
FIFss
